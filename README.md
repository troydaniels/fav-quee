Requires browser support for `<canvas>` elements.

Assuming your favicon is a 16x16px png file, simply include `fav-quee.js` in your website's header, and use the attributes `data-text` and `data-col` when linking your favicon to define the text string and its colour.

## Why?
Applications are only limited by your imagination!
Some possible uses include, but are not limited to:

1. Highly lucrative advertising space

3. Inexplicable stock ticker
4. Jazzing up your Geocities page
